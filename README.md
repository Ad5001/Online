### How to use?
By default , the plugin generates a index.html (change it !) and a 404.html .
Use the plugin folder as website root folder.

To to your website, type localhost:8080 .

To make everyone able to see your website, you need to port forward your website (if you have port forwared your server, you will also need to do this) .

There are tons of tutorials on how to portforward something (use google !) but there are some specific config to do.

Config of the port foreward:   
Name: HTTP   
Start port: 8080   
End port: 8080   
Protocol: TPC   

Start your server and profit of your website !

(I know that @Falk created a plugin called Volt that does same but this plugin works in a completly different way (that make a lot less laggy and a lot less heavier in space !) and it's fully coded by myself in PHP7)
