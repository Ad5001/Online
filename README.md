Make a website for your ImagicalMine server fully free !

This plugin is under the [Apache License v2.0](/LICENSE)

### How to use?
By default , the plugin generates a index.html (change it !), a 404.html and a 403.html .
Use the plugin folder as website root folder.

In the config, you can change: index page, 404 page, 403 page, the website port, and thz forbidden acess page.

To to your website, type localhost:Your port (by default 8080).

To make everyone able to see your website, you need to port forward your website (if you have port forwared your server, you will also need to do this) .

There are tons of tutorials on how to portforward something (use google !) but there are some specific config to do.

Config of the port foreward:   
Name: HTTP   
Start port: Your port (by default 8080)   
End port: Your port (by default 8080)   
Protocol: TPC   

Start your server and profit of your website !

(I know that @Falk created a plugin called Volt that does same but this plugin works in a completly different way (that make a lot less laggy and a lot less heavier in space !) and it's fully coded by myself in PHP7)
